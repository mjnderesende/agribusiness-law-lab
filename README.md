# Agribusiness Law Laboratory in Python 🚜 ⚖️ 🐍
A study repository applying Python to Agribusiness Law scenarios. Building algorithmic foundations through practical exercises.

## Methodology 🧪

This repository chronicles a structured evolution in Python proficiency, moving from foundational concepts to advanced computational techniques. The pedagogical framework reinforces this trajectory: upon studying a new topic, whether basic control flow or complex Object-Oriented patterns, I utilize Generative AI models to synthesize specific challenges rooted in Brazilian Agribusiness Law.

These AI-generated prompts function as dynamic testing grounds, scaling in complexity alongside my technical growth. By strictly limiting the AI's role to problem generation, every line of code remains a manual implementation, ensuring that the journey from elementary syntax to sophisticated system design is built on genuine cognitive effort and practical application.

To uphold academic integrity and reproducibility, each exercise file documents the specific AI model and the verbatim prompt employed. This metadata provides the necessary context for the challenge, distinguishing clearly between the machine-generated problem statement and the human-authored solution.
